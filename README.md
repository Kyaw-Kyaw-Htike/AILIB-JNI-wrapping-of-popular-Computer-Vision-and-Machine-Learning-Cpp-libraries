AILIB: JNI wrapping of popular Computer Vision and Machine Learning C++ libraries

This project containsÂ custom Java Native Interface (JNI) wrapping of several well-known Computer Vision and Machine Learning techniques and algorithms written in C/C++ from some popular libraries such as OpenCV Library, Piotr Dollar's toolbox, and VLFeat open source library. In particular, the algorithms currently available are:

- reading image (uses opencv)
- showing image (uses opencv)
- resizing image (uses opencv)
- writing image to file (uses opencv)
- read video and grab frames (uses opencv)
- compute gradients and orientations of given image (uses piotr dollar)
- compute gradient histograms (Hog) of given image (uses piotr dollar)
- train SVM classifier given supervised data (uses VLfeat)
- extract local binary pattern features from given image (uses VlFeat)
- extract HOG features given image (uses VLFeat)
- apply k-means clustering on given data with given hyper-parameters (uses VLFeat)
- compute SIFT features given image and hyper-parameters (uses VLFeat)
- compute dense SIFT features given image and hyper-parameters (uses VLFeat)

Only the rights corresponding to the wrapping code belongs to the author. The portions of code from the OpenCV, Piotr Dollar and VLFeat libraries belong to the respective owners.
